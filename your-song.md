### Additional Services

#### Songwriting Coaching

If you have done some songwriting of your own and would like some feedback, direction, or co-writing help with the lyrics and/or music, I am available to consult online at a rate of \$50 per hour-long session.

#### Custom Song Tutorial

If you’d like to play the custom song I’ve written and would like to learn the chords, rhythm, melody, etc. or want to learn it in a different key that suits your vocal range, I am available for an online lesson at the rate of \$50 per hour-long session.

#### Live or Online Performance

In cases where travel is reasonable and my schedule allows, I can perform your custom song in person for a fee of $225 plus travel and lodging expenses. I can also perform your song online (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.) for $75.
