I enter into this collaborative effort with gratitude for your business and your trust. Songwriting is a subjective process. Once you’ve provided me with the basic direction to get started, I’ll set out with great care to craft the best song I can. Because of the nature and intensity of creative work, and the non-linear manner in which art is made, I’m unable to involve you in artistic decisions and changes after I’ve gathered the initial style and content information from you.

I don’t have a refund policy. It’s my goal that you’ll be satisfied (and that your song’s recipient will be satisfied), but if you’re not, contact me and we’ll see what we can figure out together.

I’ll also feature some of these songs and your testimonials for promotional and marketing purposes on social media and on this website (unless, of course, you purchase the commercial usage and licensing rights). I would especially appreciate videos of song reactions to use on this website and on social media. If you’re willing to share written testimonials or videos of your experience with your custom song, email them to <a href="mailto:charliescustomsongs@gmail.com">charliescustomsongs@gmail.com</a>.

Thank you!
