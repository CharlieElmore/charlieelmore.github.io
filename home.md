I’m Charlie. I love making music and I love telling stories, and God’s gifted me with the ability to do both.

Years ago, I wrote a wedding song for some dear friends. Recently, the husband reached out with a special request. He wanted to commission me to write and record a song for his wife to celebrate her birthday, only he wanted me to express what was on his heart and to sing from his perspective.

I had such a great time writing and recording, and my friends were both so delighted with the song that I decided to offer my services to a broader audience. So here we are!

I’d love to write a song for you. I would love to put the person, the place, or anything you’re celebrating into song. I believe you’ll love the results.

I can help you give the gift of song for:

- Accomplishments
- Adoptions
- Anniversaries
- Baby dedications
- Birthdays
- Business jingles
- Engagements (you could even propose with the song!)
- Friendship celebrations
- Funerals (for slideshows or other uses)
- Graduations
- Grieving
- Holidays
- Recovery (injury, illness, surgery, addiction, etc.)
- Retirements
- Reunions
- Weddings (ceremonies and/or wedding videos)
- Other special occasions

**NOTE:** I don’t write revenge or break-up songs or anything intended to hurt or spite others. I also don’t use profanity or suggestive material in my songs.

### How it works

Answer the brief questionnaire, choose either the Basic or Premium Package and any extras, and I’ll start writing and recording your custom song (the finished song will be around 3-4 minutes long). Within 3 weeks of your purchase, I will email you a high-quality digital recording of your song (MP3 format) along with a chord chart and lyrics sheet that you can print and frame to give to your song’s recipient.

### Questionnaire (your answers may or may not be included in the song)

- Who and what is your song for? (first name, relationship, and occasion)
- What are some of your favorite things about this person / place / thing?
- Any “must include” names, phrases, references, or stories? (limit to 3-4 items. If including an uncommon name, please provide pronunciation help)
- What emotion do you want the song to convey? (joyful, melancholy, humorous, reflective, romantic, or no preference)
- What musical style do you want? (folk/indie, pop/rock, country, or no preference)
- By what date do you need the song? (allow up to three weeks)
- What is your email address and phone number? (I will only use your contact information if I have questions and to deliver your song)

## About Charlie

I have a Bachelor of Arts in English/Creative Writing from the University of New Mexico. I have written over 200 songs and I’ve recorded and released three studio albums of original music (released under the name Chuck Elmore and available on digital platforms if you’d like to preview my work).

I’ve been singing since I was a young boy, playing guitar for over 30 years, playing drums, percussion, and bass for nearly as long, and experimenting with a host of other instruments (piano, mandolin, banjo, dulcimer, harmonica, and more) for a good chunk of time, too.

The musical genres that have influenced me include pop, rock, soul, R&B, folk, country, blues, jazz, and Americana.

I have an amazing wife, three beautiful daughters, a wonderful son-in-law, and two really cool dogs.

## Good-faith Agreement

I enter into this collaborative effort with gratitude for your trust and your business. Songwriting is a subjective process. I’ll ask you to provide me some basic direction to get started, and from there I’ll set out with great care to craft the best song I can. Because of the nature and intensity of creative work, and the non-linear manner in which art is made, I’m unable to involve you in artistic decisions and changes after I’ve gathered the initial style and content information from you.

I don’t have a refund policy. It’s my goal that you’ll be satisfied (and that your song’s recipient will be satisfied), but if you’re not, contact me and we’ll see what we can figure out together.

I’ll also feature some of these songs and your testimonials for promotional and marketing purposes on social media and on this website (unless, of course, you purchase the commercial usage and licensing rights).
