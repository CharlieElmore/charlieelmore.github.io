I’m Charlie. I love making music and I love telling stories, and God’s gifted me with the ability to do both.

Years ago, I wrote a wedding song for some dear friends. Recently, the husband reached out with a special request. He wanted to commission me to write and record a song for his wife to celebrate her birthday, only he wanted me to express what was on his heart and to sing from his perspective.

I had such a great time writing and recording, and my friends were both so delighted with the song that I decided to offer my services to a broader audience. So here we are!

I’d love to write a song for you. I would love to put the person, the place, or anything you’re celebrating into song. I believe you’ll love the results.

I can help you give the gift of song for:

- Accomplishments
- Adoptions
- Anniversaries
- Baby dedications
- Birthdays
- Business jingles
- Engagements (you could even propose with the song!)
- Friendship celebrations
- Funerals (for slideshows or other uses)
- Graduations
- Grieving
- Holidays
- Recovery (injury, illness, surgery, addiction, etc.)
- Retirements
- Reunions
- Weddings (ceremonies and/or wedding videos)
- Other special occasions

**NOTE:** I don’t write revenge or break-up songs or anything intended to hurt or spite others. I also don’t use profanity or suggestive material in my songs.

### How it works

Answer the brief questionnaire, choose either the Basic or Premium Package and any extras, and I’ll start writing and recording your custom song (the finished song will be around 3-4 minutes long). Within 3 weeks of your purchase, I will email you a high-quality digital recording of your song (MP3 format) along with a chord chart and lyrics sheet that you can print and frame to give to your song’s recipient.
