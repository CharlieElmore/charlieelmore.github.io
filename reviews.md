“Charlie wrote 'Hold You Close' and sang it at our wedding. The
song was so personal and really spoke of our love story, not to
mention it was a beautiful melody and song. It’s something that I
will treasure forever and pass on to my kids and grandkids.” (hear the song below)

“For my wife’s 50th birthday, I wanted to do something
extraordinary. I decided to task my longtime friend Charlie with
writing a song. Charlie took my basic, raw thoughts concerning
my wife, and penned them into the most beautiful song called
'God Gave The Queen'. This masterpiece will be a treasure for
the rest of our lives!”

“My husband gave me the most amazing and personal gift for my
50 th birthday. It was a song dedicated and written for me. What I
loved about it was that it was very personal and made me feel
very special. It was as if my husband was speaking words of life
to me. It’s a gift unlike any other gift I have received and one that I
will treasure forever and will share with my friends and family from
generation to generation.”
