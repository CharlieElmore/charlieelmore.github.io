I have a Bachelor of Arts in English/Creative Writing from the
University of New Mexico. I have written over 200 songs and I’ve
recorded and released three studio albums of original music
(released under the name Chuck Elmore and available on digital
platforms if you’d like to preview my work).

I’ve been singing since I was a young boy, playing guitar for over
30 years, playing drums, percussion, and bass for nearly as long,
and experimenting with a host of other instruments (piano,
mandolin, banjo, dulcimer, harmonica, and more) for a good
chunk of time, too.

The musical genres that have influenced me include pop, rock,
soul, R&amp;B, folk, country, blues, jazz, and Americana.
I have an amazing wife, three beautiful daughters, a wonderful
son-in-law, and two great dogs.
