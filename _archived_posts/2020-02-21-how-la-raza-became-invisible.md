History happens to people, our little lives are like the cells of a hologram, they are miniature replicas of a larger historical narrative.
Grandma Coyota

My mother, Grace Graham King, was one of the privileged white women who came to Taos shortly after it was conquered by the United States. She came to study art, wandered into my father’s drugstore on the plaza and drank the chocolate soda he made her. Alfredo Antonio Rodriguez’s Aztec ancestors knew the aphrodisiac qualities of chocolate. So despite the mutual horror of their families, they married. That was about 1935.

In 1962 she published a little book of cartoons entitled “VIVA LOS TURISTAS!” from which I include two drawings. Tourism was a byproduct of the art colony, whose stunning images revealed to the world our only resources – achingly beautiful land and strikingly different cultures. Almost all of Mother’s drawings are spoofs on the way the local community perceived the tourists – clueless. (illustration 1 –from booklet “can we see artists paint?”)

Artists and writers had just put Taos on the map, and among Mother’s peers were such names as Willa Cather, Georgia O’Keefe, Mary Austin, Millicent Rodgers, and of course Mabel Dodge Lujan. They helped shape the role our local art community inherited in our famously diverse but racially segregated “Tri-Cultural-Paradise” plays today.

Eager to escape the restrictions of Victorian society, passionate to preserve “vanishing” art forms, these women, the painters & the society they founded were unconscious of participating in the colonization of a people whose worldview was completely unknown to them. In fact, it was precisely the difference itself that inspired their passion to consume the exotic. Cultural appropriation was not then recognized as racist or damaging.

The paintings of Phillips, Sharp, Couse, Blumenschien, Berninghaus and Dunton were pivotal in developing the tourist industry. They collectively marketed their images of Indians to Fred Harvey, who used them to launch the tourist business in the Southwest.

There is some clutching of pearls (see the PBS production, “Painting Taos” KNME 2009) over questioning the artistic integrity of intentionally painting for advertising purposes – “Is it real art?” I love the paintings, I saw them as a child and still love them. OK - so they painted for money. I know that’s tacky, but the real question here is moral integrity. Tourism is the last stage of colonialism, and colonialism is violence. This might not have been as clear in 1930 as it is now, but today people who do not understand the violence implicit in colonialism are guilty of willful ignorance.

Commercializing “otherness” is inherently racist, and the tourist industry is flagrantly guilty of cultural appropriation and stereotyping. There is flagrant privilege in the continuing indifference to the collective impact these Anglo artists and the community they founded had on the cultures that “inspired” them. (#2 – “…Built with FHA?” from booklet)

Let me paraphrase Ursula Le Guin: “If you declare any kind of person to be fundamentally different from you, as men have to women, class has done to class or race has done to race – you may hate them, or deify them but in either case you have made them into things, to which the only possible relationship is a power relationship. And thus you have fatally impoverished your own reality.”

While Mabel and friends were using their white privilege to support the return of Blue Lake (which was a good thing) and painting Indians, the same people were literally stealing Hispanic santos, our religious art, and were vocally unsympathetic about the loss of the land grants. “Well! They stole it from the Indians.”

The loss of land caused shattering cultural trauma and impoverishment. It meant the loss of grazing, agricultural and food-gathering rights, it drove men and adult children elsewhere to find work. From a self-sustaining agricultural people with an intact, functioning culture we became landless, cheap, seasonal labor. These effects continue into the present. New Mexico’s unemployment rate, poverty, addiction rate, lack of housing, jobs, education, high property crime and racial apartheid can all be traced to the loss of the land and the system that appropriated it.

Mabel manifested an iconic narrative of her time when she married Tony Lujan from Taos Pueblo. She lived in real life the myth of the Noble Savage, conceived by Aldous Huxley who was a member of her clique. Hers was THE marriage in the society of her time, featured in newspapers from Taos’s El Crepusculo to the New York Times.
Along with the subtly racist mythologizing of the noble savage comes the image of the ignoble savage - to borrow a term from Tomas Atencio, historian. Hispanics became the ignoble savages. The myths and biases of every time in history shape the attitudes of whole communities and impact personal lives.

My mother’s marriage to a self-identified Mexican, is an example. Her family had nowhere near the Dodge fortune, but Mother was a member of the small Anglo clique, the daughter of upper-class southerners. My father was poor, but from a family of educators and a business owner. But the day after their modest wedding no Anglo OR Spanish-speaking person congratulated them, not on the plaza or in the drugstore. Their marriage was unmentionable. This says a lot about the complexity of racism in New Mexico and the depth of feelings about it.

The Hispanic people of the north have been erased to the extent that on Wikipedia it says “The Taos art colony is an art colony founded in Taos, New Mexico, by artists attracted by the rich culture of the Taos Pueblo and beautiful landscape. Hispanic craftsmanship of furniture, tin work and more played a role in creating a multicultural tradition of art work in the area.”

You could conclude from reading this that Hispanics are extinct, or that our artifacts were created by invisible people. In a public interview for director of a local museum Pueblo culture was recognized something a director would be expected to know something about - but Hispanics were never mentioned.

Why did La Raza end up being erased from view? Lots of reasons.

The Mexican-American war. We were demonized as the enemy only a few years before the founding painters arrived. Even my mother, born one year after the Mexican Revolution (1910), mixed poison for Pancho Villa in her doll dishes. The literature of the time described the local population as "dirty, ignorant, drunken and lazy." New Mexico's petition for statehood was denied because of this “social undesirability.” So partly in the hopes that statehood would stop the massive land fraud, our politicians decided to emphasize our Spanish blood to "whiten" the petition - which was still not granted until 1912 and did not stop the land loss.

In the eyes of Protestants riding the wave of Manifest Destiny the picturesque enchantment attributed to the noble Pueblo savages did not extend to the ignoble Catholic Mexican savages – instead it was our land and religious art they wanted, not our spirituality. The hippies repeated this syndrome of selective racism like some kind of eerie group reincarnation.

While Dennis Hopper bought Mabel’s house and posted armed guards on the roof to look out for the ignoble savages, or Chicanos, inside noble savages from the Pueblo partied on Dennis’s nickel. Also characteristic of both generations of newcomers is the erasure of the United States’ conquest of 1847, and an emphasis on the Spanish conquest of 1540. I always wondered if another reason for making us invisible was a way of erasing guilt for swallowing our land with half of Mexico.

In Taos a real estate agency was actually named “Doughbelly Price’s Clip Joint.” Doughbelly was a local character with a pronounced paunch, and we don’t need to ask who was getting “clipped.” Perhaps the most famous among the corrupt land speculators drawn to the statewide land boom was Arthur Manby, who was murdered in Taos. My father was one of the businessmen who found his decapitated corpse when they went to collect unpaid debts.

One of Daddy’s stories: Manby owned the springs that still bears his name and the grazing land above. He sold it repeatedly to poor sheepherders, and when their sheep were conveniently corralled and several payments pocketed he would dress up as a ghost and scare them off, keep the money, the sheep and sell it again. (3 Manby & sheep – my drawing)

The new conquerors let the Indians keep most of the land immediately surrounding the Pueblos, although there was continuing encroachment everywhere else. But 85% of the land grants upon which the Spanish-speaking people had lived for centuries was lost in a historic, frenzied land grab before Anglo painters got here. The government confiscated millions of acres and converted it into BLM and Kit Carson Forest; land speculators accumulated the biggest tracts of land in the history of the country – such as the Maxwell Grant. “Cuando vino el alhambre, vino el hambre.” “When the wire came, hunger came.”

This unequal application of laws, and different perceptions of Natives and Mexicans upset an old and fragile relationship between two old neighbors already on the defensive. And the new players brought the programming of a white supremacist system behind them, which always divides.

(5 illustration of horseshoe game)

In my father’s time many people spoke Tiwa and Spanish. There were tri-lingual horseshoe games on the plaza, liberally peppered with jokes. Over centuries, while sharing the water, trading, fighting the Comanches and Apaches together, intermarrying, squabbling, we changed each other, we blended. There were formal ceremonial relationships, like cross-cultural standing up for a marriage, confirmation or baptism (Compadrasco).

Pueblos and the Hispanics share the same DNA. And we share the same poverty – the fate of all savages in a racist country, whether noble or ignoble. The real division here is not between ignoble and noble savages, but between savages and “non-savages” in a country founded on white supremacy.

Under the new laws the old relationship between Taos Pueblo and Hispanic Taos town began to break down. The selective application of racism and property laws had consequences.

It was open season on the Hispanic farm lands, villages and commons, and private property was taxed - whereas Pueblo villages and lands were held in trust and could not be not sold, taxed, or mortgaged. This had severe economic consequences on the reservations, and is one of the reasons for poverty and the lack of development, but it permitted greater cultural cohesiveness and privacy at the same time. Hispanic villages and private houses were subject to sale, breaking up extended families and weakening intergenerational support systems.

Back to the tenacious grip the “Tri-Cultural Paradise” myth has on New Mexico’s self-image, consider the reality: The two older two communities in northern New Mexico have been historically traumatized and continue to be in ways that Anglo migrants have not. Whatever personal hardships our Anglo neighbors have survived, they have not been conquered as a people, lost their land, been enslaved and their community has not been subjected to systematic genocide, mass incarceration, ongoing police killings, and racial violence.

History tells us that not only is the dispossession of Native peoples and the legacy of slavery a living part of our country’s present circumstances – but science is saying that the emotional impact of violence on our ancestors changes our bodies. Basically, the ground-breaking science of epigenetics says that the traumas of previous generations “turn on” or “turn off” certain genes linked to disease. This discovery is revolutionizing biology, psychology, medicine and changing the way we think about history.

What you just read is a window into the hearts, the blood memory and bones of all the Hispanic and Native strangers you pass on the street. And it is just a peek into the grand, sweeping, complicated, tragic, bloody, beautiful, violent story of those of us who have ancestors buried here.
